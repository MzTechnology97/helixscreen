# Upgrading HelixScreen

This guide helps you upgrade HelixScreen to a newer version.

> For platform-specific upgrade commands (the two-step offline process on printers without HTTPS fetch tools, the AD5X chroot path, bundled-installer locations), see your printer's install guide; start from the [router table in the Installation Guide](INSTALL.md#which-printer-are-you-installing-on).

---

## Quick Upgrade

The preferred ways to update are inside the app itself (**Settings > Help & About > About > Check for Updates**) or the Mainsail/Fluidd update manager. From the command line instead, on any host with direct internet access:

```bash
curl -sSL https://releases.helixscreen.org/install.sh | sh -s -- --update
```

Your settings (`settings.json`), environment overrides (`helixscreen.env`), and custom files (custom printer images, etc.) are automatically preserved across updates.

Printers without direct internet access or HTTPS fetch tools (Creality K1, Adventurer 5M, Adventurer 5X) use a two-step or chroot procedure instead; each printer's install guide has the exact commands.

## If the Setup Wizard Keeps Appearing

After upgrading, if HelixScreen keeps showing the setup wizard on every boot, your configuration file format may have changed in a way that's incompatible with the new version.

### Quick Fix

The easiest solution is to delete your config file and let the wizard create a new one:

**MainsailOS (Pi):**
```bash
sudo rm ~/helixscreen/config/settings.json
sudo systemctl restart helixscreen
```
> If HelixScreen runs as root (the `/opt/helixscreen` install), the config is at `/opt/helixscreen/config/settings.json` instead.

**Adventurer 5M (Forge-X):**
```bash
rm /opt/helixscreen/config/settings.json
/etc/init.d/S90helixscreen restart
```

**Adventurer 5M (Klipper Mod):**
```bash
rm /root/printer_software/helixscreen/config/settings.json
/etc/init.d/S80helixscreen restart
```
(Klipper Mod v00.06 and newer installs to `/opt/helixscreen`, so its settings file is `/opt/helixscreen/config/settings.json`.)

**Creality K1 (Simple AF):**
```bash
rm /usr/data/helixscreen/config/settings.json
/etc/init.d/S99helixscreen restart
```

After restarting, the wizard will guide you through setup again. Your printer settings (Klipper, Moonraker) are not affected; only HelixScreen's display preferences need to be reconfigured.

### Alternative: Factory Reset from UI

If you can access the settings panel before the wizard appears:

1. Navigate to **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
2. Tap **System**
3. Scroll down to **Factory Reset**
4. Tap **Factory Reset** and confirm

This clears all HelixScreen settings and restarts the wizard.

## What's Preserved During Upgrades

The installer automatically preserves:

- **`settings.json`**: All your settings (printer connection, display preferences, sound, safety, etc.)
- **`helixscreen.env`**: Any environment variable overrides you've set
- **Custom files**: Custom printer images, user-added printer database entries, and other files in the `config/` directory

You should not need to reconfigure anything after a normal upgrade. If something does go wrong, see the troubleshooting sections below.

---

## What Settings Are Affected by a Reset

If you perform a factory reset or delete your config, you'll need to reconfigure:

- WiFi connection (if not using Ethernet)
- Moonraker connection (usually auto-detected)
- Display preferences (brightness, theme, sleep timeout)
- Sound settings
- Safety preferences (E-Stop confirmation)

Your Klipper configuration, Moonraker settings, print history, and G-code files are **not affected**; they're stored separately.

---

## Upgrade to Specific Version

```bash
curl -sSL https://releases.helixscreen.org/install.sh | sh -s -- --update --version v1.2.0
```

### Reinstall a Version with Fresh Settings

The command above keeps your existing `settings.json`. To reinstall a specific version **and** reset HelixScreen's settings to defaults at the same time, use `--clean` instead of `--update`:

```bash
curl -sSL https://releases.helixscreen.org/install.sh | sh -s -- --clean --yes --version v1.2.0
```

`--yes` is required because a piped command cannot ask for confirmation; if you download the script and run it interactively over SSH, you get the confirmation prompt instead. `--clean` removes HelixScreen's settings and caches, then installs the version you specified. Your Klipper config, Moonraker settings, print history, and G-code files are **not** affected.

---

## Checking Your Version

**On the touchscreen:** **Settings > Help & About > About** shows the current version

**Via SSH:** run `<install-path>/bin/helix-screen --version`. The binary's location varies by platform; each printer's install guide lists its path.

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues after upgrading:

1. Ask in the [HelixScreen Discord](https://discord.gg/RZCT2StKhr) for quick help
2. Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common problems
3. View logs for error messages: on systemd hosts, `sudo journalctl -u helixscreen -n 50`. Log locations for the other platforms are in your printer's install guide.
4. Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen/issues) with your version and any error messages
