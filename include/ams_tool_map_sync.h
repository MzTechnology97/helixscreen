/**
 * @file ams_tool_map_sync.h
 * @brief One writer for the two directions AmsSystemInfo states its tool map in.
 *
 * AmsSystemInfo carries the tool<->slot mapping twice:
 *
 *   - forward: AmsSystemInfo::tool_to_slot_map[tool] = global slot
 *              read by helix::ui::resolve_op_button_slot (which lane the
 *              filament panel's Load/Unload/Purge buttons act on), by the
 *              print-start remap snapshot, and by AmsState::build_ams_topology
 *   - reverse: SlotInfo::mapped_tool per slot
 *              read by the AMS panel's per-lane tool badge
 *
 * A backend that writes one direction by hand and leaves the other to a default
 * drifts, and the two surfaces then disagree about which physical lane a tool
 * number names. That has shipped twice in opposite directions: QIDI Box wrote
 * only mapped_tool and badged the remapped lane while the buttons operated on
 * the original one; CFS wrote only tool_to_slot_map and did the inverse.
 *
 * SlotRegistry::set_tool_mapping() is the canonical bookkeeping for "a tool maps
 * to exactly one slot" — it maintains both directions in lockstep and evicts
 * whichever side loses a contested tool number. Backends that keep their slot
 * state on an AmsSystemInfo rather than in a registry (CFS, ToolChanger, QIDI)
 * can still use it: run the mapping through a throwaway registry and read both
 * directions back out. These helpers are that pass, so each backend states only
 * WHICH direction its firmware is authoritative in.
